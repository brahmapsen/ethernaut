Ethernaut Challenge Recovery Level 17

PROBLEM: The "Recovery" Contract creates the "SimpleToken" Contract using the "generateToken" function. From the Debug console of the browser,
you have the address of the "Recovery" Contract but not the address of ""SimpleToken" Contract. It is as if the address of SimpleToken is lost.

The SimpleToken contract was paid 0.5 token as part of the last transaction from Recovery Contract.

OBJECTIVE: get the 0.5 token be paid back to your Account(Wallet) address from the the SimpleToken contract. 

APPRAOCH: 
- Find the address of the SimpleToken contract
- use that address to create a SimpleToken instance and 
- call the selfDestruct function on that SimpleToken instance 

FIND THE ADDRESS OF SIMPLETOKEN CONTRACT:
1) you can deterministically compute the address by using your account (Wallet) address that created this Contract 
   or you can look it up in ROPSTEN Etherscan by looking up all the transactions using the Recovery 
2) With the address, you can selfdestruct the simpleToken Contract that you created and have the payout to your Wallet address.

STEPS:
1. Make sure your MetaMask is pointing to Ropsten and "console" option selected in debug (Inspect option in Browser)
2. Get new instance of the Recovefry problem
3. Find the Instance address ( This is the address of Recovefy Token)
4. Open "https://ropsten.etherscan.io/"
5. Type the instance address and hit search
6. Click on the transaction Hash of in the "Contact Creator" of "More Info" box
7. Notice the 0.5 Ether in the "To" in Overview tab.
8. Click on last "To-->" address --- this is the address of the SimpleToken Contract. Go to STEP 8B for an alternative way to get the SIMPLETOKEN Contract address
9. Go to Remix. Copy the SimpleToken contract code. Also copy the following code:
   contract RecoverToken{
    address payable receiver = msg.sender;
    SimpleToken simpleToken;
    
    function destroySimpleToken(address payable simpleTokenAddress) public{
        simpleToken = SimpleToken(simpleTokenAddress);
        simpleToken.destroy(receiver);
    } 
   }

10. Make sure correct compiler version 6.6 selected. Compile the code
11. Selected Deploy Ethereum icon from left in REMIX. 
    Make sure "Injected Web3" selected in Environment in Remix. I lost a lot of time because I had deafult onm"Javscript VM" was selected.
12. Deploy the RecoverToken - make sure this is selected in the CONTRACT drop down in the left side of REMIX
13. Check your wallet balance
14. Invoke destroySimpleToken. Provide the SimpleToken address copied in STEP 8.
15. That should transfer 0.5 token to your Account (Wallet).
16. Now you can "Submit instance" for the Challenge.

8B.
NOTE: There is another way to get the contract address. This command works only on the 0.5 version of the ethernaut challenge.
Calculate the contact address:(From yellow paper)
The address for an Ethereum contract is deterministically computed from the address of its creator (sender) and how many transactions the creator has sent (nonce). 
The sender and nonce are RLP encoded and then hashed with Keccak-256 and then the right most 160 bits of the Keccak hash is taken.

address = rightmost_20_bytes(keccak(RLP(sender address, nonce))

web3.utils.soliditySha3("0xd6", "0x94", <instance address>, "0x01")
Take the last 40 characters of the hash. That will be the address of SIMPLETOKEN contract.
